            <p class="my-2">This site is a collection of all my writing. I love to write and have dedicated quite a bit of time and energy expressing myself, sharing my passions, and learning about this great wide wild world we have been given to explore.</p>
            <p class="my-2">In no particular order I present a history of what I have written and published on the world wide web over the years.</p>

            <p class="my-2">Somebody once told me that <span class="italic">"No self respecting hacker can call themselves such without maintaining a blog about their coding exploits"</span>. I cannot remember who told me that though <span role="img" aria-label="thinking face">&#129300;</span>... Maybe I just made it up.</p>

            <p class="my-2">I have been an avid cyclist since I got my first real bike for my 16th birthday (up until then all my bikes had been cheap Kmart specials that fell apart the first day of riding). Something always felt just slightly off kilter, and I could not put my exact feelings into words. Then I discovered gravel bikes and I knew immediately it was what I had been looking for all along in cycling.</p>
