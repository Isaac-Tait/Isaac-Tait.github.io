            <p class="my-2">This site is a collection of all my writing. I love to write and have dedicated quite a bit of time and energy expressing myself, sharing my passions, and learning about this great wide wild world we have been given to explore through my writing.</p>
            <p class="my-2">In no particular order I present a history of what I have written and published on the world wide web over the years.</p>

            <p class="text-xl">Fallfish Tenkara</p>
            <p class="my-2">In my humble opinion this project is my <span class="font-bold italic">pièce de résistance</span>. I have poured countless hours maintaining it and building it into something reputable. I still get contacted throughout the year from folks around the world interested in tenkara and/or Japan through this site.</p>
            <p class="my-2">Check out the site <a class="text-red-500 hover:text-blue-500 hover:bg-white" href="https://fallfishtenkara.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (I wrote all but one of the 120+ posts).</p>

            <p class="my-2">Somebody once told me that <span class="italic">"No self respecting hacker can call themselves such without maintaining a blog about their coding exploits"</span>. I cannot remember who told me that though <span role="img" aria-label="thinking face">&#129300;</span>... Maybe I just made it up.</p>

            <p class="text-xl">Macadam Grinding</p>
            <p class="my-2">I have been an avid cyclist since I got my first real bike for my 16th birthday (up until then all my bikes had been cheap Kmart specials that fell apart the first day of riding). Something always felt just slightly off kilter, and I could not put my exact feelings into words. Then I discovered gravel bikes and I knew immediately it was what I had been looking for all along in cycling.</p>
            <p class="my-2">Check out my cycling blog <a class="text-red-500 hover:text-blue-500 hover:bg-white" href="https://macadamgrinding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

            <p class="text-xl">My Novel</p>
            <p class="my-2">Tentatively I am calling it <span class="italic underline">The Wormwood Saga</span>. It is still very much a work in progress.</p>
            <p class="my-2">My vision is for it to one day be a collaborative open source novel with contributions to its content from several authors and artists (do you want to be one?). There will be a modest fee associated with gaining access to the full novel.</p>
            <p class="my-2">Check out the GitHub repo <a class="text-red-500 hover:text-blue-500 hover:bg-white" href="https://github.com/Isaac-Tait/The_Wormwood_Saga_basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

            <p class="text-xl">Tenkara Angler Magazine</p>
            <p class="my-2">While living in Japan I had two major writing projects <span class="italic underline">Tenkara Angler Magazine</span> and <span class="italic underline">Fallfish Tenkara</span>. Tenkara Angler was comprised of long form essays about tenkara and Japan. </p>
