        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>This site is a collection of all my writing. I love to write and have dedicated quite a bit of time and energy expressing myself, sharing my passions, and learning about this great wide wild world we have been given to explore.</p>
        <p>In no particular order I present a history of what I have written and published on the world wide web over the years.</p>
    
        <h4>Seattle Backpackers Magazine</h4>
        <p>For several years I was the Gear Manager at Seattle Backpackers Magazine. I also wrote a lot of articles for them too.</p>

        <p>Somebody once told me that "No self respecting hacker can themself such without maintaining a blog about their coding exploits". I cannot remember who told me that though... Maybe I just made it up.</p>
